00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,280
-Hi. In this video, we are going to have
another look at the Spotter.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,120
The Spotter can be accessed
either by going to Tools, then Spotter

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,040
or hitting Shift+Enter.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,400
From within the Spotter, you can have
access to the menu, the different tools,

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,680
anything, but you can look for,
for example, class Point.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,680
If I go over to Point and press Enter,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,520
it will open the system browser
on the correct class and package.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,840
But another thing you can do is,
if I go back to Point,

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,560
if I now would like
to dive into this class,

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,960
I can press the blue arrow.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,840
Another thing I can do
is toggle the preview,

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
so pressing Cmd+P
or clicking on this gray arrow.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,200
Cmd+P will toggle
the preview on this browser.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,440
If I press this blue arrow
or press Cmd+Right,

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,040
Cmd+Right
will dive into the Point class.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,640
I have different categories: Instance
methods, Super instance methods,

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,320
Class methods. I can look into them
by using "#instance", for example.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,680
I will only have the Instance methods
or the Instance variables.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,560
If I want to dive
into this method there,

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,040
I can just press Cmd+Right, or I can
dive into all the Instance methods

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,200
using Cmd+Shift+Right.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,040
This will bring me to all the Instance
methods, reflectedAbout.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,800
I have a preview on the right.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,800
And if I am not interested
in all of these methods,

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,000
I can simply press Cmd and go back
on the left to go back to the beginning.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,080
So, Point, Spotter, and I am back here.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,360
Now, another thing
that is nice with the Spotter

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,560
is that if I write something
to the Playground, for example,

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,000
if I write "Date today". I print it
and we are the 10th of May 2020.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,640
If I shut this window, now what I can do
is go back to the Spotter, Shift+Enter,

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,160
and you can see the history there.
We can go by scrolling,

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,120
but if I write "#Playground", you can
see there #Playground named pages,

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,240
#Playground cached pages.
So, for example, here,

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,480
we can press Enter
on this #Playground cached pages,

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,200
and it will open a Playground with
the last piece of code that was written.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,640
So, it can help you if you forgot
what you had in your Playground

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
before closing it.
It can help you handle it.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,600
Finally, if you are
from within the Spotter,

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,200
you can go into your file system
by using "./".

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,720
Right there, we are in the file system
and I will enter any of the directories

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,840
or mounted shells.
So, I will just type "#files".

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
Those are all the files around my image.
You can see that there is my image here,

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,240
"W5-LiveA.image", and we can go
over to the jpg, for example.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
This will open the image.
Another thing that we can do is...

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,520
If I go back to "#files",
there is a zip document

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
and I can go into it
by pressing Cmd+Right.

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,680
This will make me go into it, see it.
I can see there is another jpg.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
You can see that there is a text file
that I can get a preview from.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,800
I can open the jpg
by simply pressing Enter.

52
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,160
The Spotter can really help you explore
both the internal system of Pharo

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,200
and the external system around it

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,480
if you need to access
some external documents.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,440
I really encourage you to use it.

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,720
It is much easier
if you learn the shortcuts.

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,240
Cmd+Right to dive into,
toggle the preview,

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
or Cmd+Left to come back.
