-Hi. In this video,
we are going to have a look

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,720
at how you can basically customize
the startup of your Pharo image.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,480
In order to do so, first we are going to
have a look at the StartupAction class.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,600
So, StartupAction.
This is how it is used.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,000
On startup, Pharo will call
a StartupPreference

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,760
in order to run
a specific series of startup actions.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,960
In order to see this, what I am going
to do is to plug in StartupAction.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,480
In order to find them, you go to your
Pharo environment, System, Startup,

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,960
Version Preferences folder.
And from there,

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,720
you select Create file
and you name your file "startup.st".

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,800
Press OK.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,280
For now, what I will do is copy a piece
of code that should remove the logo.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,240
You can see that basically it is
consisting of a StartupPreferencesLoader

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,160
that will execute
a series of startup actions.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,280
This one is named "Logo" and you can
plug any piece of code you want.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,040
So, they are simply
"showDesktopLogo: false".

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I will remove this Pharo logo
in the background. I will save this.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,120
You can quit this.
Now juste save and quit.

19
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,840
Go back to our Pharo launcher,
double click on your image,

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,200
and you can see
that the logo has disappeared.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,000
You can plug in any code you want.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,200
You might log your GitHub credentials
for example

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,840
or if you want to change the color
to some colors you like better.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,400
You can do what you want.
This is how it is done.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,920
If we want to revert it,
what we will have to do

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,680
is to go back to System. I can change
it there by going to startup.st.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,080
For example, if we would like the logo
to come back, we set it to "true".

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,000
You do not have to close
and reopen your image.

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,040
You can simply go to Run startup script.
And our logo is back again.
