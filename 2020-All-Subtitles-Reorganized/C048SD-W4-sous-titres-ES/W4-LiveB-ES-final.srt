"Git: Creating a remote repository to an
existing project"

-Hi. In this video,
we are going to have a look

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,840
at how we can actually push the counter
package that we have online on GitHub.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,080
In order to do so, we already have
the MyCounter repository stored locally.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,440
What we are going to do
is double-click on it

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,600
and go to the MyCounter working copy.
We can go to the repository.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,760
What we are going to need
is an actual remote.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,240
You can see that we can add a remote.
What is a remote?

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,120
It is the online counterpart
of your local repository.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,000
We are going to need to create this.
In order to do so,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,400
you can head to your GitHub page,
go to Repositories

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,920
and then go over to New
to create the MyCounter package.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,160
"A small counter example in Pharo".

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
We will create this repository.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,520
We now have an empty repository
that is going to host

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,360
our actual Pharo implementation
of the counter. We will go back to Pharo.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,200
This is our repository.
You can see that we have 3 commits.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,720
You should have maybe different commits
or not the same names.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,280
Basically, you simply have to understand
that those commits will be pushed

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
to the GitHub repository.
We go over to the Add remote button.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,000
We need to name it. It is good practice
to name it "Origin".

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,080
The remote URL can be found here
under the HTTPS button.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,880
You can copy and paste this.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,840
Copy and paste.
It should be your username

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,960
slash the name you gave
to the repository. Press Ok.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,400
It is adding the remote.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Now, you can see that we have got
a red stamp near the Push button.

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,360
This means that there are some changes
that have been committed

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,720
because we can see
that it is up to date,

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,080
but they have not been pushed.
So let us push them right now. Push.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,560
You can see that it is going
to push these 3 commits. Press Ok.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
Push. So, it is pushing to Origin.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Since we are using HTTPS,
we will need to log into GitHub.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,560
You can store them
if you plan on using it again. Ok.

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,920
It is pushing to Origin.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,880
Now it should be done.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
We can see that the red stamp near
the Push button has disappeared,

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,480
so let us head over to GitHub.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
Let us refresh the page.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,840
You can see
that we now have our project.

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,960
If you go into src, you can see
our MyCounter package,

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,880
we can see the different classes.
Everything is now hosted on GitHub.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,680
This is the way you can add a remote
to your locally saved project.
