-Hi. In this video, we are going to look
at the class counterpart

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,520
of the implementors
and senders functionalities.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,800
So, let's open
the System Browser once more.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,200
So, Tools, System Browser,
go to AST-Core,

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,720
RBComment, for example,
or any other class.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,160
You can right click on the class
and go to the Class references.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,560
You can see that it even has
the same shortcut as the senders.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,200
So, click on that.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,840
You will have all the references
to the RBComment

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,560
that are made in bodies of methods
in the system.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,400
Right there, we have four of them.

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,320
You can investigate them,
as with implementors and senders,

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,320
and another thing
is that this functionality is so useful

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,840
that it has
its own button in the interface.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,000
So, right here, you can click on it
to open the same references.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
Another important thing is,
when looking at instance variables,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
you can highlight them.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
Right click, go to Code search.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,600
This will help you have access
to senders and implementors as well,

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,520
but most importantly,
to References to it.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,440
If we look at it, there are basically

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,480
all the references
to the instance variable contents.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
This will really help you understand

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,120
how the instance variable
is used within the class.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,720
So, those functionalities
coupled with the ones of the methods

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,320
will really help you understand classes,

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
their architectures
and how they work together,

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,560
with the instance variables,
how they are sent,

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,480
and you can look for examples,
which is really important.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,480
You can look for examples
using the senders functionality.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,120
So, they have the same shortcut,
Cmd+N, to look at the references.

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,520
Or you can click on Class refs.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,280
And if you want to look
for the references to instance variable,

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Shift+Cmd+N
will open References to left.
