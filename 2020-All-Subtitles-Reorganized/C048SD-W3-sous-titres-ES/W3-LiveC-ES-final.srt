-Hi. In this video, we are going to look
at how we can look for a class in Pharo,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,600
so how to use the Spotter tool.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,920
You can access the Spotter tool
by going to Tools, Spotter.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,600
This will open the Spotter,
but you can also press Shift+Enter

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,720
and it will open the Spotter as well.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,840
If you search for a class named "Point",
for example,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,040
and simply write "Point",
then go to Classes and double click,

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,200
this will open the System Browser
on the correct class.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, if you go back
to calling the Spotter,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,600
so Shift+Enter,

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,680
it will save the history
of your searches,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so you will have the last call
to the class stored.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,920
This will really help you

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,000
access something
you just opened and closed,

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,960
and you would like to open again.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,880
So, Shift+Enter, then press back Enter,

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,760
and this will open the last class
you just searched for.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,280
We will look into more tips
about the Spotter in the next videos.
